# TikTok Shop API skill

Read public TikTok Shop data as clean JSON. This TikTok Shop API skill returns a product, its reviews, a shop's catalogue, a creator's showcase, and keyword product search — all at 3 credits. TikTok Shop is where a large share of social commerce now happens, and it is barely covered by conventional e-commerce data tools.

This skill wraps **5 live TikTok Shop endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- You are researching what sells on TikTok Shop in a category.
- You need reviews for a TikTok Shop product to gauge sentiment or quality.
- You are tracking which products a creator promotes in their showcase.
- You are comparing a product's TikTok Shop listing against other marketplaces.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need seller-account data** — orders, fulfilment, payouts. That is account-scoped; TikTok's Shop Partner API covers it.
- **You confused this with the main TikTok skill.** Videos, transcripts and creator stats live in `tiktok-api`; this skill is the commerce surface only.
- **You need guaranteed live stock or price.** Responses may be cached; use `--fresh` when it matters.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_product.js` | Get TikTok Shop product. | url | 3 credits |
| `get_product_reviews.js` | List TikTok Shop product reviews. | url | 3 credits per review |
| `get_products.js` | List TikTok Shop products. | url | 3 credits per product |
| `search.js` | List TikTok Shop search. | query | 3 credits per product |
| `get_user_showcase.js` | List TikTok Shop user showcase. | handle | 3 credits per product |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/tiktokshop/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/tiktok-shop-api/scripts/search.js "phone case"
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/tiktokshop/product` | url | product | 3 credits | no |
| `/v1/tiktokshop/product-reviews` | url | review | 3 credits per review | yes |
| `/v1/tiktokshop/products` | url | product | 3 credits per product | yes |
| `/v1/tiktokshop/search` | query | product | 3 credits per product | yes |
| `/v1/tiktokshop/user-showcase` | handle | product | 3 credits per product | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I search TikTok Shop products?

`search.js` with a query returns matching products at 3 credits each.
