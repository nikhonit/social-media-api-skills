# Google API skill

Read public Google results as clean JSON. This Google API skill returns search result pages, Google Business Profile details, the reviews and updates attached to a business, and the ads a company is running — the core inputs for local SEO work, reputation monitoring and competitive research.

This skill wraps **5 live Google endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- You need SERP results for a query, as structured data rather than HTML.
- You are monitoring a business's Google reviews or its profile details.
- You want to see what ads a company is running.
- You are doing local SEO and need what Google publishes about a listing.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need Google Search Console or Analytics data** for a property you own. Those are account-scoped; use Google's own APIs.
- **You need Maps places data.** Use the `google-maps-api` skill — `place`, `photos` and `contacts` live there.
- **You need news results.** Use `google-news-api`. Shopping results are in `google-shopping-api`, and interest-over-time is in `google-trends-api`.
- **You are firing searches speculatively.** Each result costs credits.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_business_info.js` | Get Google Search business info. | url|handle | 3 credits |
| `get_business_reviews.js` | List Google Search business reviews. | url|handle | 2 credits per review |
| `get_business_updates.js` | List Google Search business updates. | url | 3 credits per post |
| `get_company_ads.js` | List Google Search company ads. | url|handle | 3 credits per ad |
| `search.js` | List Google Search search. | query | 2 credits per page |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/google/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/google-api/scripts/get_business_reviews.js nasa
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/google/business-info` | url|handle | place | 3 credits | no |
| `/v1/google/business-reviews` | url|handle | review | 2 credits per review | yes |
| `/v1/google/business-updates` | url | post | 3 credits per post | yes |
| `/v1/google/company-ads` | url|handle | ad | 3 credits per ad | yes |
| `/v1/google/search` | query | page | 2 credits per page | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I get Google search results as JSON?

`search.js` with a query returns results at 2 credits per result. Use `--limit` to keep volume down.

### Can I monitor Google reviews for a business?

Yes. `get_business_reviews.js` takes the business URL or handle and returns reviews at 2 credits each. `get_business_info.js` returns the profile itself.

### Is this an official Google API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Google. It returns publicly available data only.

### Which skill do I use for Maps, News, Shopping or Trends?

Each is a separate skill in this repo, because each is a separate set of endpoints: `google-maps-api`, `google-news-api`, `google-shopping-api`, `google-trends-api`.
