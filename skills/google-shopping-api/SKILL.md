# Google Shopping API skill

Read public Google Shopping results as clean JSON. This Google Shopping API skill is a single endpoint: search products by keyword and get back listings with merchants and prices, at 3 credits per product — useful for price comparison, market research and competitive monitoring.

This skill wraps **1 live Google Shopping endpoint** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- You are comparing prices for a product across merchants.
- You need to see how a product is listed and priced in the shopping index.
- A user asks where to buy something and at what price.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need a single merchant's catalogue.** Go to that merchant — `amazon-api` and `tiktok-shop-api` cover theirs.
- **You need guaranteed live prices.** Results may be cached and merchant prices move; pass `--fresh` when accuracy matters more than speed.
- **You need Merchant Center data for your own store.** That is account-scoped; use Google's own API.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Permissions and scope

These scripts do exactly three things and nothing else: read one environment variable (`SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY`), send HTTPS requests to `https://api.scrapersocial.com` (the host is a constant in the code, not configurable), and print JSON. They run as `node scripts/<name>.js` with no other shell use, no file writes and no persistence. `call_endpoint.js` accepts only the 1 documented `/v1/google_shopping/` paths in the table below and refuses anything else before a request is made.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `product_search.js` | List Google Shopping product search. | query | 3 credits per product |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/google_shopping/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/google-shopping-api/scripts/product_search.js "mechanical keyboard"
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/google_shopping/product-search` | query | product | 3 credits per product | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I search Google Shopping as JSON?

`product_search.js` with a query, 3 credits per product returned. Use `--limit` to bound the cost.

### Are the prices live?

They reflect what the shopping index published when the page was read, and may be cached. Use `--fresh` to bypass the cache at the same credit cost.

### Is this an official Google API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Google. It returns publicly available data only.
