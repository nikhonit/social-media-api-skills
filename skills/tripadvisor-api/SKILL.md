# Tripadvisor API skill

Read public Tripadvisor data as clean JSON. This Tripadvisor API skill does two things: search for hotels, restaurants and attractions, and pull the reviews for one. Review text is the valuable part — it is the most detailed public record of what guests actually experienced at a property.

This skill wraps **2 live Tripadvisor endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- You are researching a hotel, restaurant or attraction and want its reviews summarised.
- You are benchmarking a property against competitors on rating and review themes.
- A user pastes a Tripadvisor link and asks whether the place is any good.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need live availability or pricing.** Not covered — this is listings and reviews, not a booking API.
- **You manage the property.** Tripadvisor's own management centre gives owners more.
- **You are pulling every review for a large hotel.** Reviews are charged per item; scope with `--limit`.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Permissions and scope

These scripts do exactly three things and nothing else: read one environment variable (`SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY`), send HTTPS requests to `https://api.scrapersocial.com` (the host is a constant in the code, not configurable), and print JSON. They run as `node scripts/<name>.js` with no other shell use, no file writes and no persistence. `call_endpoint.js` accepts only the 2 documented `/v1/tripadvisor/` paths in the table below and refuses anything else before a request is made.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_reviews.js` | List Tripadvisor reviews. | url | 3 credits per review |
| `search.js` | List Tripadvisor search. | query | 3 credits per place |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/tripadvisor/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/tripadvisor-api/scripts/search.js "hotels in Lisbon"
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/tripadvisor/reviews` | url | review | 3 credits per review | yes |
| `/v1/tripadvisor/search` | query | place | 3 credits per place | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I get Tripadvisor reviews as JSON?

`get_reviews.js` with the property URL, 3 credits per review returned. Use `--limit` and `--cursor` to page.

### How do I find a property without its URL?

`search.js` with a query returns matching properties at 3 credits each.

### Does this include hotel prices or availability?

No. Listings and reviews only.

### Is this an official Tripadvisor API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Tripadvisor. It returns publicly available data only.
