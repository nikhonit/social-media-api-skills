# Google Trends API skill

Read public Google Trends data as clean JSON. This Google Trends API skill has two endpoints: `explore` returns interest-over-time for a term, and `rising` returns the related queries gaining momentum around it — the standard inputs for keyword research, trend spotting and content planning.

This skill wraps **2 live Google Trends endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- You are checking whether interest in a topic is growing or fading.
- You want the rising related searches around a seed keyword, for content or SEO planning.
- A user asks whether something is trending.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need absolute search volume.** Trends returns relative interest, indexed to 100 — it is not a volume estimate, and no endpoint here converts it into one.
- **You need per-result cheapness.** `explore` costs 6 credits, the priciest non-AI call in this repo outside the video endpoints. Do not loop it over a large keyword list without checking the budget.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Permissions and scope

These scripts do exactly three things and nothing else: read one environment variable (`SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY`), send HTTPS requests to `https://api.scrapersocial.com` (the host is a constant in the code, not configurable), and print JSON. They run as `node scripts/<name>.js` with no other shell use, no file writes and no persistence. `call_endpoint.js` accepts only the 2 documented `/v1/google_trends/` paths in the table below and refuses anything else before a request is made.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_explore.js` | Get Google Trends explore. | query | 6 credits |
| `get_rising.js` | List Google Trends rising. | query | 3 credits per query |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/google_trends/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/google-trends-api/scripts/get_explore.js "electric vehicles"
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/google_trends/explore` | query | report | 6 credits | no |
| `/v1/google_trends/rising` | query | query | 3 credits per query | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I get interest over time for a keyword?

`get_explore.js` with the query, 6 credits per call.

### How do I find rising related searches?

`get_rising.js` with a seed query, 3 credits per result returned.

### Does this give me search volume numbers?

No. Google Trends publishes relative interest on a 0–100 index, not absolute volume. Anything presenting it as volume is inferring, not reporting.

### Is this an official Google API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Google.
