# Polymarket API skill

Read public Polymarket data as clean JSON. This Polymarket API skill has a single endpoint: search markets by query and get back the listings with their current odds, at 1 credit per market. Prediction market prices are a genuinely useful forecast signal, and this is a cheap way to put them in front of an agent.

This skill wraps **1 live Polymarket endpoint** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- A user asks what the market thinks the odds of an event are.
- You want a forecast signal to compare against commentary or polling.
- You are tracking how odds on a question move over time.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You are placing trades.** This is read-only and is not trading infrastructure. Nothing here executes orders, and the odds may be cached rather than live.
- **You are presenting odds as fact.** They are a market price, not a prediction from an authority — say so when you surface them.
- **You need order book depth or historical series.** One endpoint, current listings only.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_markets.js` | List Polymarket markets. | query | 1 credit per market |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/polymarket/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/polymarket-api/scripts/get_markets.js "election"
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/polymarket/markets` | query | market | 1 credit per market | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I get prediction market odds?

`get_markets.js` with a query returns matching markets and their odds, 1 credit per market.

### Are the odds live?

They may be served from cache. Pass `--fresh` to bypass it at the same credit cost, but treat the result as indicative rather than an execution price.

### Can I trade through this?

No. Read-only. Use Polymarket directly for anything transactional.

### Is this an official Polymarket API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Polymarket.
