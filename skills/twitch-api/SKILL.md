# Twitch API skill

Read public Twitch data as clean JSON. This Twitch API skill returns a streamer's profile, a single clip, or a channel's video listing — 2 credits each. It is the quick read for creator research on Twitch when you do not want to register an application and manage OAuth tokens.

This skill wraps **3 live Twitch endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- You are researching a streamer: their profile, their recent videos, their clips.
- A user pastes a Twitch clip and asks what it is or who made it.
- You are building a cross-platform creator profile that includes Twitch.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need live stream status or chat.** Not covered here. Twitch's own API and EventSub handle real-time state properly.
- **You are building a Twitch integration proper.** The official API is free, richer and supports subscriptions to live events.
- **You need viewer or revenue analytics.** Account-scoped and not public.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_clip.js` | Get Twitch clip. | url|handle | 2 credits |
| `get_profile.js` | Get Twitch profile. | handle | 2 credits |
| `get_user_videos.js` | List Twitch user videos. | handle | 2 credits per video |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/twitch/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/twitch-api/scripts/get_profile.js <streamer-handle>
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/twitch/clip` | url|handle | clip | 2 credits | no |
| `/v1/twitch/profile` | handle | profile | 2 credits | no |
| `/v1/twitch/user-videos` | handle | video | 2 credits per video | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### What can I get from Twitch?

Three endpoints at 2 credits each: `get_profile.js` for a streamer, `get_clip.js` for a clip, and `get_user_videos.js` for a channel's videos.

### Can I tell whether someone is live right now?

Not reliably — there is no live-status endpoint here, and responses may be cached. Use Twitch's own API for real-time state.

### Is this an official Twitch API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Twitch or Amazon. It returns publicly available data only.
