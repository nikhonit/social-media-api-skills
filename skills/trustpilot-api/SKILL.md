# Trustpilot API skill

Read public Trustpilot reviews as clean JSON. This Trustpilot API skill has a single endpoint: give it a company URL or handle and it returns their reviews at 1 credit each — the cheapest review source in this repo, and the standard reference for company reputation in Europe.

This skill wraps **1 live Trustpilot endpoint** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- You are assessing a company's reputation before recommending or transacting with them.
- You are monitoring your own or a competitor's review flow.
- A user asks whether a company is trustworthy and you want evidence rather than an impression.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need to reply to reviews or flag them.** Read-only; Trustpilot's Business API covers that.
- **You are pulling every review for a large brand.** Charged per review — scope with `--limit`.
- **You need product-level reviews.** This is company-level. Product reviews live in `amazon-api`, `tiktok-shop-api`, `app-store-api` and `google-play-api`.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_reviews.js` | List Trustpilot reviews. | url|handle | 1 credit per review |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/trustpilot/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/trustpilot-api/scripts/get_reviews.js nasa
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/trustpilot/reviews` | url|handle | review | 1 credit per review | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I get Trustpilot reviews as JSON?

`get_reviews.js` with the company URL or handle, 1 credit per review returned.

### Can I get an overall rating?

The review listing carries the rating data Trustpilot publishes alongside each review. There is no separate summary endpoint.

### Is this an official Trustpilot API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Trustpilot. It returns publicly available review data only.
