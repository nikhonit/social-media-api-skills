# Kwai API skill

Read public Kwai data as clean JSON. This Kwai API skill returns a creator profile, that creator's posts, or a single video by URL. Kwai is one of the largest short-video platforms in Latin America and South Asia and is poorly served by Western data tools, which is most of the reason this skill exists.

This skill wraps **3 live Kwai endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- You are researching creators or short-video trends in markets where Kwai has real share.
- A user pastes a Kwai link and asks who posted it or what the account is.
- You are benchmarking a creator's Kwai presence against their TikTok or Instagram.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You assumed Kwai mirrors TikTok.** They are different platforms with different creators; do not present one as a proxy for the other.
- **You need transcripts or AI summaries.** Kwai has three endpoints — profile, posts and a single post. There is no transcript capability here.
- **You need to post or interact.** Read-only.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_post.js` | Get Kwai post. | url | 2 credits |
| `get_profile.js` | Get Kwai profile. | url|handle | 2 credits |
| `get_user_posts.js` | List Kwai user posts. | url|handle | 2 credits per post |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/kwai/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/kwai-api/scripts/get_profile.js <kwai-handle>
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/kwai/post` | url | post | 2 credits | no |
| `/v1/kwai/profile` | url|handle | profile | 2 credits | no |
| `/v1/kwai/user-posts` | url|handle | post | 2 credits per post | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### What can I get from Kwai?

Three things: `get_profile.js` for a creator, `get_user_posts.js` for their posts, and `get_post.js` for one video. Each costs 2 credits.

### Can I transcribe a Kwai video?

Not through this API. Transcripts are available for TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X and YouTube.

### Is this an official Kwai API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Kwai or Kuaishou. It returns publicly available data only.
