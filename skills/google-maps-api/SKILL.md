# Google Maps API skill

Read public Google Maps data as clean JSON. This Google Maps API skill returns place details from a Maps URL, searches places by query, pulls the photos attached to a place, and extracts business contact details — the building blocks for local lead lists, store locators and location research.

This skill wraps **4 live Google Maps endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- A user pastes a Google Maps link and wants the place's details.
- You are building a local prospect list for a category and area.
- You need contact details for businesses matching a search.
- You want the photos associated with a location.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need routing, geocoding or a map widget.** Google's Places and Directions APIs do those properly, with a licence that permits display.
- **You are compiling personal data.** `get_contacts.js` returns business contact details; treat the output under GDPR and local law, and do not use it for unsolicited bulk contact where that is restricted.
- **You need reviews.** Business reviews live in the `google-api` skill, not this one.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Permissions and scope

These scripts do exactly three things and nothing else: read one environment variable (`SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY`), send HTTPS requests to `https://api.scrapersocial.com` (the host is a constant in the code, not configurable), and print JSON. They run as `node scripts/<name>.js` with no other shell use, no file writes and no persistence. `call_endpoint.js` accepts only the 4 documented `/v1/google_maps/` paths in the table below and refuses anything else before a request is made.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_contacts.js` | List Google Maps contacts. | query | 3 credits per place |
| `get_photos.js` | List Google Maps photos. | url | 1 credit per image |
| `get_place.js` | Get Google Maps place. | url | 3 credits |
| `search.js` | List Google Maps search. | query | 2 credits per place |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/google_maps/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/google-maps-api/scripts/search.js "coffee shops in Seattle"
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/google_maps/contacts` | query | place | 3 credits per place | yes |
| `/v1/google_maps/photos` | url | image | 1 credit per image | yes |
| `/v1/google_maps/place` | url | place | 3 credits | no |
| `/v1/google_maps/search` | query | place | 2 credits per place | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I get place details from a Google Maps URL?

`get_place.js` with the Maps URL returns the place as structured JSON, for 3 credits.

### How do I find places by keyword?

`search.js` with a query, 2 credits per result returned. Use `--limit` to control cost.

### What does the contacts endpoint return?

`get_contacts.js` takes a query and returns business contact details at 3 credits per result. It is business data, not personal profiles — use it accordingly.

### Is this an official Google Maps API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Google. If you need to display a map or compute routes, use Google's own Platform APIs.
