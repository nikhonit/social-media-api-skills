# Amazon API skill

Read public Amazon listing data as clean JSON. This Amazon API skill fetches a product page by URL, searches the catalog by keyword, pulls customer reviews, and lists the sellers offering a given item — useful for price tracking, competitive research, and review-mining without maintaining a scraper against one of the most defended sites on the web.

This skill wraps **4 live Amazon endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- A user pastes an Amazon product URL and wants the title, price, rating or specifications.
- You are comparing how a product is priced or positioned across sellers.
- You need the review text for a product to summarise sentiment or pull out recurring complaints.
- You want to find products matching a keyword and rank them.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need order, account or Seller Central data.** This reads public listing pages only. Use Amazon's own SP-API for anything tied to an account.
- **You need a live price guarantee.** Prices change constantly and responses may be served from cache. Pass `--fresh` when the exact current price matters.
- **You want a plain keyword search endpoint called `search`.** Amazon's search capability here is `product-search`; there is no `/v1/amazon/search`.
- **A product link appears in passing** with no question attached. Calls cost credits.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_product.js` | Get Amazon product. | url | 3 credits |
| `product_search.js` | List Amazon product search. | query | 3 credits per product |
| `get_reviews.js` | List Amazon reviews. | url | 3 credits per review |
| `get_sellers.js` | List Amazon sellers. | url | 3 credits per offer |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/amazon/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/amazon-api/scripts/get_product.js https://example.com/some-public-url
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/amazon/product` | url | product | 3 credits | no |
| `/v1/amazon/product-search` | query | product | 3 credits per product | yes |
| `/v1/amazon/reviews` | url | review | 3 credits per review | yes |
| `/v1/amazon/sellers` | url | offer | 3 credits per offer | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I get Amazon product data as JSON?

Run `get_product.js` with the product URL. It returns the listing as structured JSON for 3 credits. For keyword lookups use `product_search.js` instead.

### Can I get Amazon reviews through the API?

Yes. `get_reviews.js` takes a product URL and returns reviews, charged 3 credits per review returned. Cap the volume with `--limit`.

### Is this an official Amazon API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Amazon. It returns publicly available listing data only.

### Why is my price slightly stale?

Responses can come from cache, which is what makes them fast. Add `--fresh` to bypass the cache at the same credit cost.
