# Pinterest API skill

Read public Pinterest data as clean JSON. This Pinterest API skill returns a pin by URL, searches pins by keyword, and — the genuinely useful one — reports how many times any URL has been saved to Pinterest. That last endpoint costs 1 credit and is a real distribution signal for a page you publish.

This skill wraps **3 live Pinterest endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- You want to know how much traction one of your URLs has on Pinterest.
- You are researching visual trends or how a product is being pinned.
- A user pastes a pin link and wants its details.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need to create pins or boards.** Read-only; Pinterest's own API handles writes.
- **You need board-level or account analytics.** Only pins, search and URL save counts are covered.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_pin.js` | Get Pinterest pin. | url | 2 credits |
| `search.js` | List Pinterest search. | query | 2 credits per pin |
| `get_url_stats.js` | Get Pinterest url stats. | url | 1 credit |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/pinterest/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/pinterest-api/scripts/search.js "small kitchen renovation"
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/pinterest/pin` | url | pin | 2 credits | no |
| `/v1/pinterest/search` | query | pin | 2 credits per pin | yes |
| `/v1/pinterest/url-stats` | url | url | 1 credit | no |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I check how often a URL was saved to Pinterest?

`get_url_stats.js` with the URL returns its save count for 1 credit. It works for any URL, not just ones you own.

### How do I search Pinterest?

`search.js` with a query, 2 credits per pin returned.

### Is this an official Pinterest API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Pinterest. It returns publicly available data only.
