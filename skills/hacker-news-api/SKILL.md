# Hacker News API skill

Read public Hacker News data as clean JSON. This Hacker News API skill returns a story, its full comment thread, a user's profile, or keyword search across the site — all at 1 credit, which makes it a good endpoint to smoke-test your key with.

This skill wraps **4 live Hacker News endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- A user pastes an HN link and wants the discussion summarised.
- You are researching how a product, company or idea was received by that audience.
- You want to track mentions of a term on Hacker News.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need the whole firehose or historical bulk.** The official Firebase API and the Algolia HN search API are free and better suited to bulk work.
- **You need to post or vote.** Read-only.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Permissions and scope

These scripts do exactly three things and nothing else: read one environment variable (`SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY`), send HTTPS requests to `https://api.scrapersocial.com` (the host is a constant in the code, not configurable), and print JSON. They run as `node scripts/<name>.js` with no other shell use, no file writes and no persistence. `call_endpoint.js` accepts only the 4 documented `/v1/hackernews/` paths in the table below and refuses anything else before a request is made.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_profile.js` | Get Hacker News profile. | handle | 1 credit |
| `search.js` | List Hacker News search. | query | 1 credit per story |
| `get_story.js` | Get Hacker News story. | handle | 1 credit |
| `get_story_comments.js` | List Hacker News story comments. | handle | 1 credit per comment |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/hackernews/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/hacker-news-api/scripts/get_profile.js pg
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/hackernews/profile` | handle | profile | 1 credit | no |
| `/v1/hackernews/search` | query | story | 1 credit per story | yes |
| `/v1/hackernews/story` | handle | story | 1 credit | no |
| `/v1/hackernews/story-comments` | handle | comment | 1 credit per comment | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I get the comments on a Hacker News story?

`get_story_comments.js` with the story handle returns the thread at 1 credit per comment. `get_story.js` returns the story itself.

### Why use this instead of the free official HN API?

Only for consistency with the other platforms here — same envelope, same client, same key. If HN is your only source, the official API is free.

### Is this an official Hacker News API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Hacker News or Y Combinator.
