# Google Finance API skill

Read public Google Finance data as clean JSON. This Google Finance API skill returns a current quote for an instrument, historical price candles, and search across tickers — at 1 credit per call, which makes it practical to poll a watchlist.

This skill wraps **3 live Google Finance endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- A user asks what a stock, index or currency pair is trading at.
- You need historical candles to chart or compute a return.
- You need to resolve a company name to a ticker symbol.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You are making trading or investment decisions on this data.** It is a convenience read of a public page, not an exchange feed. It is not licensed market data, may be delayed, and may be served from cache.
- **You need tick-level or real-time data.** Use a market data vendor.
- **You need fundamentals, filings or analyst estimates.** Not covered here.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Permissions and scope

These scripts do exactly three things and nothing else: read one environment variable (`SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY`), send HTTPS requests to `https://api.scrapersocial.com` (the host is a constant in the code, not configurable), and print JSON. They run as `node scripts/<name>.js` with no other shell use, no file writes and no persistence. `call_endpoint.js` accepts only the 3 documented `/v1/google_finance/` paths in the table below and refuses anything else before a request is made.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_history.js` | List Google Finance history. | handle | 1 credit per candle |
| `get_quote.js` | Get Google Finance quote. | handle | 1 credit |
| `search.js` | List Google Finance search. | query | 1 credit per instrument |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/google_finance/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/google-finance-api/scripts/get_quote.js AAPL
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/google_finance/history` | handle | candle | 1 credit per candle | yes |
| `/v1/google_finance/quote` | handle | quote | 1 credit | no |
| `/v1/google_finance/search` | query | instrument | 1 credit per instrument | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I get a stock quote as JSON?

`get_quote.js` with the instrument handle, for 1 credit. Use `search.js` first if you only know the company name.

### Can I get historical prices?

Yes. `get_history.js` returns candles, charged 1 credit per candle returned, so set `--limit` deliberately.

### Is this real-time data?

No. Treat it as indicative. Responses may be cached; `--fresh` bypasses the cache at the same cost, but the underlying page is not an exchange feed.

### Is this an official Google API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Google.
