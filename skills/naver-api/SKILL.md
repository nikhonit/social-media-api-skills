# Naver API skill

Read public Naver results as clean JSON. This Naver API skill covers the four searches that matter on Korea's dominant portal: blog posts, cafe articles, local businesses and shopping listings. If you are researching the Korean market, Google data will not represent it — Naver is where the audience and the content actually are.

This skill wraps **4 live Naver endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- You are researching the Korean market and need sources Google does not index well.
- You are tracking a brand's presence in Naver blogs or cafe communities.
- You need Korean local business listings or shopping prices.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You expect Google-equivalent coverage in English.** Results are Korean-language and Korean-market; query accordingly.
- **You need Naver's own account or ad data.** Not covered; Naver publishes its own developer APIs for that.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `blog_search.js` | List Naver blog search. | query | 2 credits per post |
| `cafearticle_search.js` | List Naver cafearticle search. | query | 2 credits per post |
| `local_search.js` | List Naver local search. | query | 2 credits per place |
| `shop_search.js` | List Naver shop search. | query | 2 credits per product |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/naver/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/naver-api/scripts/blog_search.js "coffee shops"
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/naver/blog-search` | query | post | 2 credits per post | yes |
| `/v1/naver/cafearticle-search` | query | post | 2 credits per post | yes |
| `/v1/naver/local-search` | query | place | 2 credits per place | yes |
| `/v1/naver/shop-search` | query | product | 2 credits per product | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### What can I search on Naver?

Four endpoints, 2 credits per result each: `blog_search.js`, `cafearticle_search.js`, `local_search.js` and `shop_search.js`.

### Should I query in Korean?

Yes. Naver indexes Korean-language content, and Korean queries return substantially better results.

### What is a cafe article?

Naver Cafe is a large community forum platform. `cafearticle_search.js` searches posts inside those communities — often the most candid source on a brand in Korea.

### Is this an official Naver API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Naver. It returns publicly available data only.
