# Bluesky API skill

Read public Bluesky data as clean JSON. This Bluesky API skill returns a profile, a user's posts, or keyword search results across the network — at 1 credit per call, which makes it one of the cheapest ways to monitor a conversation on an open social platform.

This skill wraps **3 live Bluesky endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- You are tracking what a specific Bluesky account is posting.
- You want keyword search across public posts, for monitoring a brand or topic.
- A user pastes a Bluesky handle and asks who it is or what they post about.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need to post, reply or follow.** This is read-only. Bluesky's own AT Protocol API handles writes and is free for authenticated users.
- **You need the full firehose.** These are point queries, not a streaming feed. For real-time ingestion at volume, connect to the protocol directly.
- **You need private or blocked-account data.** Public data only.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_profile.js` | Get Bluesky profile. | handle | 1 credit |
| `search.js` | List Bluesky search. | query | 1 credit per post |
| `get_user_posts.js` | List Bluesky user posts. | handle | 1 credit per post |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/bluesky/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/bluesky-api/scripts/get_profile.js bsky.app
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/bluesky/profile` | handle | profile | 1 credit | no |
| `/v1/bluesky/search` | query | post | 1 credit per post | yes |
| `/v1/bluesky/user-posts` | handle | post | 1 credit per post | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I get Bluesky posts for a user?

`get_user_posts.js` with the handle returns their public posts, 1 credit per post returned.

### Do I need a Bluesky account?

No. These endpoints read public data and authenticate against ScraperSocial, not Bluesky.

### Is this an official Bluesky API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Bluesky. Bluesky also publishes its own open API, which is a better fit if you need writes or the firehose.

### What does it cost?

1 credit per call, or per item on the paginated endpoints. The 100 free signup credits go a long way here.
