# Spotify API skill

Read public Spotify catalogue data as clean JSON. This Spotify API skill returns a track, album, artist, an artist's top tracks, a playlist, or search results across the catalogue — 2 credits per call, no OAuth dance, no token refresh loop.

This skill wraps **6 live Spotify endpoints** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- A user pastes a Spotify link and wants the track, album or artist details.
- You are building a music research or recommendation workflow that needs catalogue metadata.
- You want an artist's top tracks or the contents of a public playlist.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You are building a real music app.** Spotify's own Web API is free, richer, covers playback and user libraries, and is the licensed route. Use this when you want one client across many platforms and no OAuth setup.
- **You need audio, streams or private library data.** Catalogue metadata only.
- **You need listener counts or royalties.** Not published, not available.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_album.js` | Get Spotify album. | handle | 2 credits |
| `get_artist.js` | Get Spotify artist. | handle | 2 credits |
| `get_artist_top_tracks.js` | List Spotify artist top tracks. | handle | 2 credits per track |
| `get_playlist.js` | Get Spotify playlist. | handle | 2 credits |
| `search.js` | List Spotify search. | query | 2 credits per result |
| `get_track.js` | Get Spotify track. | handle | 2 credits |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/spotify/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/spotify-api/scripts/search.js "Radiohead"
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/spotify/album` | handle | album | 2 credits | no |
| `/v1/spotify/artist` | handle | artist | 2 credits | no |
| `/v1/spotify/artist-top-tracks` | handle | track | 2 credits per track | yes |
| `/v1/spotify/playlist` | handle | playlist | 2 credits | no |
| `/v1/spotify/search` | query | result | 2 credits per result | yes |
| `/v1/spotify/track` | handle | track | 2 credits | no |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I get a Spotify track as JSON?

`get_track.js` with the track handle, 2 credits. Albums, artists and playlists have their own scripts at the same price.

### How do I get an artist's top tracks?

`get_artist_top_tracks.js` with the artist handle, 2 credits per track returned.

### Why not just use Spotify's official API?

If Spotify is your only source, do — it is free and more complete. This exists so one key and one envelope cover Spotify alongside the other 32 platforms here.

### Is this an official Spotify API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Spotify. It returns publicly available catalogue data only.
