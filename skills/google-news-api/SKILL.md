# Google News API skill

Read public Google News results as clean JSON. This Google News API skill is a single endpoint: search the news index by keyword and get back headlines, sources and links at 1 credit per article — a cheap way to give an agent current-events awareness or to monitor coverage of a company.

This skill wraps **1 live Google News endpoint** from the [ScraperSocial](https://scrapersocial.com) API. Public data only, returned as clean JSON.

## When to use this skill

- A user asks what the news says about a topic, company or person.
- You are monitoring press coverage for a brand.
- You need recent headlines as context before answering a time-sensitive question.

### Do not use this skill when

- **You need full article text.** This returns headlines and links, not article bodies.
- **You need a persistent alert.** This is a point query; scheduling and deduplication are yours to build.
- **The user's question is not time-sensitive.** Do not spend credits on background you do not need.

## Setup

```bash
export SCRAPERSOCIAL_KEY=sk_live_...   # https://scrapersocial.com/app/keys
```

Signing up at [scrapersocial.com/signup](https://scrapersocial.com/signup) includes 100 free credits, no card required.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Input | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `search.js` | List Google News search. | query | 1 credit per article |
| `call_endpoint.js` | Call any `/v1/google_news/` endpoint directly | path + params | varies |

Every script also accepts `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--fields`, `--format` and `--fresh`. `--limit` is clamped to 50: above that the API returns an async job instead of data.

## Example

```bash
node skills/google-news-api/scripts/search.js "semiconductor export controls"
```

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "meta": { "count": 20, "next_cursor": "..." }, "request_id": "a18e4ef88ad4b00b" }
```

`meta` appears on paginated endpoints only. Keep `request_id` — support traces calls with it.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Input | Returns | Credits | Paginated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/google_news/search` | query | article | 1 credit per article | yes |

Costs shown per item for paginated endpoints, per call otherwise. Failed calls are not charged.

## FAQ

### How do I search news as JSON?

`search.js` with a query, 1 credit per article returned. Set `--limit` to keep volume predictable.

### Does it return the full article?

No — headline, source and link. Fetch the article yourself if you need the body.

### Is this an official Google News API?

No. ScraperSocial is independent and not affiliated with Google. It returns publicly available data only.
